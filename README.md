# The Lobby Control Center

Discord control center with a Python/PySide6 desktop interface.

## Start on Windows

Install Python 3.12, extract the latest release ZIP, and open `start.bat`.
Keep the extracted folder as your permanent launcher folder.

## Automatic updates

From 0.1.6, fresh installations automatically check the official GitHub release
at startup and every six hours while running. Existing update preferences are
preserved. In Updates, enable automatic downloads and use:

https://github.com/Gexanth/the-lobby-control-center/releases/latest/download/release.json

Verified packages are activated at the next start through `start.bat`.
Tasks and settings are stored separately. Startup failures restore the previous
version; `restore_previous.bat` also provides manual recovery.

## Publish a version

Commit tested source changes to main and increase `VERSION` in `version.py`.
GitHub Actions validates the updater, builds the source ZIP and checksum
manifest, and publishes a versioned GitHub Release. Existing releases are never
overwritten. Workflow dispatch can retry a failed publication.

This pipeline distributes published changes; it does not develop new features.
EXE updates and changes requiring new dependencies need a full installation.
